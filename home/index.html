            a beautiful ballad written by Jimmy Van Huesen and lyrics by Eddie DeLange during the 1939. The lyrics describe about a disappointed lover who is haunted by dreams of a love that feels real while asleep but disappears upon waking. It captures the pain of wanting something (or someone) that remains just out of reach: dream always seems so real but that it canâ€™t come true.
