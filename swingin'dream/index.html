            <span class="title">Swingin’<br>Dream</span>
            <span class="intro">The tune was introduced by the Broadway musical “Swingin’ The Dream”. It was a jazz-infused Broadway adaptation of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, featuring an all-star lineup of musicians and a bold attempt to blend jazz with classic theater. Despite its ambition, the show was a commercial failure, closing after just 13 performances.

            <!-- <span class="text4">The idea of reinterpreting Shakespeare with jazz and modern influences has since been revisited in various productions.</span>
            <span class="text5">Darn That Dream aligns beautifully with Swingin’ the Dream and Shakespeare’s theme that love is an illusion, a fantasy that can bring both joy and pain.</span> -->
