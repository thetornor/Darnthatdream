    <section class="content" id="content">
        <div class="text">
            <p>Darn that dream <br>
                I dream each night <br>
                You say you love me and hold me tight <br>
                But when I awake and you're out of sight <br>
                Oh, darn that dream <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <span class="description">In the dream, their love interest expresses affection, making the dream feel real and comforting. Upon waking, reality sets in—the person they love is gone or never truly loved them.The dream feels like a cruel illusion, giving false hope and then disappearing.</span>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Darn your lips and darn your eyes <br>
                They lift me high above the moonlit sky <br>
                Then I tumble out of paradise <br>
                Oh, darn that dream <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <span class="description">The singer blames the person’s beauty (their lips and eyes) for making them fall so deeply in love. Love (even just in dreams) makes the singer feel euphoric, like they’re floating in paradise. But once the dream ends, they crash back into reality, feeling empty and heartbroken.</span>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                Darn that one track mind of mine <br>
                It can't understand that you don't care <br>
                Just to change the mood I'm in <br>
                I'd welcome a nice old nightmare <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <span class="description">The singer admits they can’t stop thinking about this person, even though they shouldn’t. Their mind refuses to accept the harsh truth: the person they love doesn’t love them back. The pain of the dream is so unbearable that they’d rather have a bad dream (a nightmare) than go through this emotional cycle again.</span>
        <div class="text">
            <p> Darn that dream <br>
                And bless it too <br>
                Without that dream I never have you <br>
                But it haunts me and it won't come true <br>
                Oh, darn that dream
            </p>
        </div>
        <span class="description">the dream is painful, but it’s also the only place where love exists. If not for the dream, they’d have nothing—so even though it’s painful, it’s the only connection they have to this love. The dream constantly returns, teasing them with what they want but can never have. Frustration, sorrow, and resignation—the dream brings love, but also unbearable heartache.</span>
